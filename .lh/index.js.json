The majority of these cities were devoted to cloning projects, as the highly intelligent Kaminoans specialized in cloning for clients needing workers or private security forces, along with other one-off requests. Due to the remoteness of the planet and its extensive rainy season, only occasional representatives of clone purchasing authorities were undeterred from visiting the world. Kamino often experienced heavy rain, and during some parts of the year was covered with heavy electrical storms. During this season, Kaminoans rode on aiwhas underwater and resurfaced once they were near their destination.

Imperial AT-ATs traverse the frozen landscape on Hoth. From space, the planet of Hoth looked like a pale blue orb due to its dense snow and ice covering. Five planets existed between Hoth and its sun, while an asteroid belt surrounded the planet with meteors occasionally striking the surface.Most of its surface was covered with glaciers and frozen ice plains. Another third of the planet was covered by oceans.The temperature, although always frigid, was known to drop to -60Â°C come nightfall.Although devoid of intelligent life, Hoth was home to fifteen subspecies of tauntauns, which were commonly used by Rebels as a means of transport, and which Han Solo cut open to use as shelter to keep Luke Skywalker and himself warm during a snowstorm. It was also home to a species of towering predators known as wampas. During his stay on Hoth, Skywalker was captured by a wampa and was hung upside down in the wampa\"s cave, waiting to be eaten. Using the power of the Force, Skywalker managed to get his hands on his lightsaber and cut himself down from the roof and sever the wampa\"s right arm.

Iol was oldest and largest settlement on Iol, and it consisted of five large, separate domes that were each at least 1 kilometer in diameter. Each dome served a particular function within the city, with one containing Haven's government institutions and another containing the city's financial institutions, and each dome had a residential section that housed workers that were employed within that particular dome. The domes were all connected to one another via a series of tubes, which allowed for easy travel throughout the city.. Haven was also linked to the settlements Menelath and Shirkel, via two repulsortrain tunnels. The city was ran by an administrator, who was selected by Tangan Industries. Around the time of the Clone Wars, the Near-Human Elexia Nis'tar was appointed as Haven's administrator and while Tangan had hoped that she would act as a figurehead that they could manipulate, she distinguished herself by prioritizing the needs of Haven's inhabitants over those of the company. Nis'tar continued to act as the city's administrator until the time of the Yuuzhan Vong war.`\",\n-  image: \"assets/Haden.jpg\"\n-}\n-];\n-\n-document.getElementById(\"searchForm\").addEventListener(\"submit\", function (event) {\n-event.preventDefault();\n-\n-const searchedPlanet = planetInput.value.toLowerCase();\n-const apiUrl = \"https://swapi.dev/api/planets/\";\n-const searchParams = `?search=${searchedPlanet}`;\n-\n-fetch(apiUrl + searchParams)\n-  .then((response) => {\n-    return response.json();\n-  })\n-  .then(data => {\n-    const planet = data.results[0];\n-\n-    if (planet) {\n-      renderPlanet(planet);\n-    } else {\n-      showError();\n-    }\n-  });\n-});\n-\n-const planetSection = document.querySelector(\".planet-section\");\n-\n-function renderPlanet(planet) {\n-// Clear previous planet elements\n-planetSection.innerHTML = '';\n-\n-const planetElement = document.createElement(\"div\");\n-const planetName = document.createElement(\"h2\");\n-planetName.classList.add(\"planetName\");\n-planetName.innerText = planet.name;\n-planetElement.appendChild(planetName);\n-\n-const planetInfo = document.createElement(\"p\");\n-planetInfo.classList.add(\"planetInfo\");\n-planetInfo.innerText = searchedPlanet.find(p => p.name.toLowerCase() === planet.name.toLowerCase())?.synopsis || \"No info collected\";\n-planetElement.appendChild(planetInfo);\n-\n-const planetImage = document.createElement(\"img\");\n-planetImage.src = searchedPlanet.find(p => p.name.toLowerCase() === planet.name.toLowerCase())?.image || \"assets/placeholder.jpg\";\n-planetInfo.appendChild(planetImage);\n-\n-planetSection.appendChild(planetElement);\n-}\n-\n-function showError() {\n-// Clear previous error message and planet elements\n-planetSection.innerHTML = '';\n-\n-const planetError = document.createElement(\"div\");\n-planetError.classList.add(\"planetError\");\n-const errorText = document.createElement(\"p\");\n-errorText.classList.add(\"errorText\");\n-errorText.innerText = \"No flights found to this planet.

When the rain came, some plants were able to grow in a brief yet glorious period. Inhabiting the planet were many native species, the largest of which were the carnivorous krayt dragons. The common krayt dragon, while more plentiful, was shadowed by the greater krayt dragon, which submerged itself under the shifting sands and used its powerful limbs to traverse through the dunes.
