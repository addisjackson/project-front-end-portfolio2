The majority of these cities were devoted to cloning projects, as the highly intelligent Kaminoans specialized in cloning for clients needing workers or private security forces, along with other one-off requests. Due to the remoteness of the planet and its extensive rainy season, only occasional representatives of clone purchasing authorities were undeterred from visiting the world. Kamino often experienced heavy rain, and during some parts of the year was covered with heavy electrical storms. During this season, Kaminoans rode on aiwhas underwater and resurfaced once they were near their destination.
